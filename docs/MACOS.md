# SmarterSmarterChild Quickstart for macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)

This guide explains how to download, configure and connect SmarterSmarterChild running on macOS (Intel and Apple
Silicon) to an AIM/OSCAR service.

1. **Register an Account**

   First create an account for your chatbot on your preferred AIM revival platformâ€”SmarterSmarterChild connects to AIM
   just like any other AIM client. If you don't know where to start, set up [Retro AIM Server](https://github.com/mk6i/retro-aim-server).
   Keep the username and password handy for the configuration step. Note that the screen names `SmarterSmarterChild` and
   `SmarterChild` may already be taken by someone else.

2. **Download SmarterSmarterChild**

   Grab the latest macOS release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mk6i/smarter-smarter-child/releases) for
   your platform (Intel or Apple Silicon).

   Because the SmarterSmarterChild executable has not been blessed by Apple, browsers such as Chrome may think it's a
   "suspicious" file and block the download, in which case you need to explicitly opt in to downloading the untrusted
   file.

   > While the binaries are 100% safe, you can avoid the security concern by [building the application yourself](./BUILD.md).
   We do not provide signed binaries because of the undue cost and complexity.

   Once downloaded, extract the `.zip` archive, which contains the application and a configuration file `settings.env`.

3. **Open Terminal**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted directory. This terminal will be used for the remaining steps.

   ```shell
   cd ~/Downloads/smarter_smarter_child.0.1.0.macos.intel_x86_64/
   ```

4. **Remove Quarantine**

   Because the SmarterSmarterChild `.app` has not been blessed by Apple, macOS will quarantine the application. To
   proceed, remove the quarantine flag from the `.app`. In the same terminal, run following command:

   ```shell
   sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./bin/smarter_smarter_child
   ```

   > While the binaries are 100% safe, you can avoid the security concern
   by [building the application yourself](./BUILD.md). We do not provide signed binaries because of the undue cost and
   complexity.

5. **Configure AIM Client Settings**

   Open `settings.env` in your favorite text editor.

    - Set `OSCAR_HOST` to your AIM provider's hostname. If you're running Retro AIM Server locally, keep the default
      value.
    - Set the `SCREEN_NAME` and `PASSWORD` values for the account you created in the first step.

6. **Configure ChatGPT Backend**

   Finally, configure the Chatbot backend that generates responses to user input. SmarterSmartChild is configured by
   default to use a mock ChatGPT service that serves canned responses.

   Configure the following values in `settings.env`:

    - If you don't want to use ChatGPT, keep `OFFLINE_MODE=true`.
    - To enable ChatGPT for AI-generated responses, set `OFFLINE_MODE=false` and set `OPEN_AI_KEY` to your OpenAI
      service account key. If you don't have one already, register for an
      [OpenAPI Platform Account](https://platform.openai.com/) (you'll need to spend a few dollars on credits) and
      create a service account.

7. **Start the Application**

   Run the following command to launch SmarterSmarterChild:

   ```shell
   ./run.sh
   ```

   SmarterSmarterChild will run in the terminal, ready to chat.
