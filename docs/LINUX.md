# SmarterSmarterChild Quickstart for Linux (x86_64)

This guide explains how to download, configure and connect SmarterSmarterChild running on Linux (x86_64) to an AIM/OSCAR
service.

1. **Register an Account**

   First create an account for your chatbot on your preferred AIM revival platformâ€”SmarterSmarterChild connects to AIM
   just like any other AIM client. If you don't know where to start, set up [Retro AIM Server](https://github.com/mk6i/retro-aim-server).
   Keep the username and password handy for the configuration step. Note that the screen names `SmarterSmarterChild` and
   `SmarterChild` may already be taken by someone else.

2. **Download SmarterSmarterChild**

   Grab the latest Linux release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mk6i/smarter-smarter-child/releases) and 
   extract the archive. The extracted folder contains the application and a configuration file `settings.env`.

3. **Configure AIM Client Settings**

   Open `settings.env` in your favorite text editor.

   - Set `OSCAR_HOST` to your AIM provider's hostname. If you're running Retro AIM Server locally, keep the default
     value.
   - Set the `SCREEN_NAME` and `PASSWORD` values for the account you created in the first step.

4. **Configure ChatGPT Backend**

   Finally, configure the Chatbot backend that generates responses to user input. SmarterSmartChild is configured by
   default to use a mock ChatGPT service that serves canned responses.

   Configure the following values in `settings.env`:

   - If you don't want to use ChatGPT, keep `OFFLINE_MODE=true`.
   - To enable ChatGPT for AI-generated responses, set `OFFLINE_MODE=false` and set `OPEN_AI_KEY` to your OpenAI
     service account key. If you don't have one already, register for an
     [OpenAPI Platform Account](https://platform.openai.com/) (you'll need to spend a few dollars on credits) and
     create a service account.

5. **Start the Application**

   Run the following command to launch SmarterSmarterChild:

   ```shell
   ./run.sh
   ```

   SmarterSmarterChild will run in the terminal, ready to chat.
