# SmarterSmarterChild Quickstart for Windows 10/11

This guide explains how to download, configure and connect SmarterSmarterChild running on Windows 10/11 to an AIM/OSCAR
service.

1. **Register an Account**

   First create an account for your chatbot on your preferred AIM revival platformâ€”SmarterSmarterChild connects to AIM
   just like any other AIM client. If you don't know where to start, set up [Retro AIM Server](https://github.com/mk6i/retro-aim-server).
   Keep the username and password handy for the configuration step. Note that the screen names `SmarterSmarterChild` and
   `SmarterChild` may already be taken by someone else.

2. **Download SmarterSmarterChild**

   Grab the latest macOS release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mk6i/smarter-smarter-child/releases) for
   your platform (Intel or Apple Silicon).

   Because the SmarterSmarterChild executable has not been blessed by Microsoft, browsers such as Chrome may think it's
   a "suspicious" file and block the download, in which case you need to explicitly opt in to downloading the untrusted
   file.

   > While the binaries are 100% safe, you can avoid the security concern by [building the application yourself](./BUILD.md).
   We do not provide signed binaries because of the undue cost and complexity.

   Once downloaded, extract the `.zip` archive, which contains the application and a configuration file `settings.bat`.

3. **Configure AIM Client Settings**

   Open `settings.bat` (right-click, `edit in notepad`).

   - Set `OSCAR_HOST` to your AIM provider's hostname. If you're running Retro AIM Server locally, keep the default
     value.
   - Set the `SCREEN_NAME` and `PASSWORD` values for the account you created in the first step.

4. **Configure ChatGPT Backend**

   Finally, configure the Chatbot backend that generates responses to user input. SmarterSmartChild is configured by
   default to use a mock ChatGPT service that serves canned responses.

   Configure the following values in `settings.bat`:

   - If you don't want to use ChatGPT, keep `OFFLINE_MODE=true`.
   - To enable ChatGPT for AI-generated responses, set `OFFLINE_MODE=false` and set `OPEN_AI_KEY` to your OpenAI
     service account key. If you don't have one already, register for an
     [OpenAPI Platform Account](https://platform.openai.com/) (you'll need to spend a few dollars on credits) and
     create a service account.
   
5. **Start the Application**

   Open `run.cmd` to launch SmarterSmarterChild.

   Because SmarterSmarterChild has not been blessed by Microsoft, Windows will flag the application as a security risk
   the first time you run it. You'll be presented with a `Microsoft Defender SmartScreen` warning prompt that gives you
   the option to run the blocked application.

   To proceed, click `More Options`, then `Run anyway`.
