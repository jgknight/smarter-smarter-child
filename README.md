# SmarterSmarterChild

**SmarterSmarterChild** is an AOL Instant Messenger chatbot that mimics the functionality of the
famous [SmarterChild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmarterChild) chatbot from the 2000's using ChatGPT.

It's called *Smarter*SmarterChild because, well, it's way more advanced than the old SmarterChild, but just as fun!

This project is a demonstration of how to create a chatbot using the public golang packages exported
by the [Retro AIM Server](https://github.com/mk6i/retro-aim-server) project.
